A Short Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

1. About Me

Hello! I am Jeff Chooi Loke Peng, a Cybersecurity Master's student at the University of Malaya. With a solid academic foundation including a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology (Computer Networking and Security), I have developed a deep-seated passion for protecting digital landscapes.

My interest in cybersecurity is driven by a fascination with ethical hacking, secure software development, and the challenge of stay ahead of evolving threats. I like to solving complex problems and am particularly interested in how machine learning and cloud security can be leveraged to build more resilient systems. Whether I am conducting vulnerability assessments or developing secure migration pipelines, my goal is to contribute to innovative, secure solutions in an ever-changing digital world.
