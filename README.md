A Short Cybersecurity Professional Portfolio

## 1. About Me

Hello! I am Jeff Chooi Loke Peng, a Cybersecurity Master's student at the University of Malaya. With a solid academic foundation including a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology (Computer Networking and Security), I have developed a deep-seated passion for protecting digital landscapes.

My interest in cybersecurity is driven by a fascination with ethical hacking, secure software development, and the challenge of stay ahead of evolving threats. I like to solving complex problems and am particularly interested in how machine learning and cloud security can be leveraged to build more resilient systems. Whether I am conducting vulnerability assessments or developing secure migration pipelines, my goal is to contribute to innovative, secure solutions in an ever-changing digital world.

## 4. Project Experience

### **Intelligent Phishing Website Detection Model (Capstone Project)**
For my capstone project, I developed a machine learning system designed to identify phishing websites and defend against zero-day attacks. Utilizing Python and algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest, I processed a dataset of over 44,000 sites from UCI and OpenPhish. By performing feature engineering on linguistic and domain-based data, the final XGBoost model achieved a 97.8% accuracy and a 99.7% ROC-AUC. This project demonstrated the power of machine learning in automating threat detection with high precision.

### **Cloud Security & Data Migration (Accenture Malaysia)**
During my internship at Accenture, I supported the secure migration of enterprise-level data from SQL environments to AWS S3. I focused on applying cloud security principles, specifically managing IAM policies and compliance standards to protect over 500 tables during the migration process. My role also involved maintaining a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to document more than 500 security and functional requirements, ensuring that the project met all governance and enterprise security standards.

### **Live Network Traffic Sniffer & Security Dashboard**
I built a real-time network monitoring tool using Scapy and Streamlit to provide visibility into live network traffic. The application captures packets directly from the network interface and classifies them to detect potential security anomalies. By integrating a web-based dashboard, users can visualize traffic patterns and filter protocols in real-time. This tool serves as a functional security asset for rapid threat identification and network troubleshooting through deep packet inspection.

## 5. Learning Journey

My journey into cybersecurity began with a Bachelor's in Information Technology, where I developed a strong foundation in networking and systems security. Transitioning into my Master’s at the University of Malaya (UM) has allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and hands-on application. So far, the course has expanded my expertise in network defense, specifically through configuring Cisco infrastructure and utilizing simulation tools like GNS3 to build secure, resilient topologies. I have also gained significant insight into the intersection of machine learning and security, particularly in how models can be trained to detect phishing attempts and malicious traffic patterns.

Despite my progress, I still find areas like **Ethical Hacking** and **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions to be challenging. These disciplines require a high level of creative problem-solving and rapid adaptation to unfamiliar environments. To improve in these areas, I plan to spend more time on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe to sharpen my penetration testing skills. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of global **Cybersecurity Frameworks** (such as NIST and ISO 27001) to ensure that my technical solutions are always aligned with industry standards and governance best practices.


## 6. Career Objective
My professional aspiration is to become a **Cybersecurity Architect** specializing in secure cloud infrastructure and AI-driven threat intelligence. Building on my background in computer networking and my current research in privacy-preserving data technologies, I aim to design security systems that are not only robust against traditional attacks but also resilient against emerging zero-day threats. I am committed to bridging the gap between technical security implementation and organizational governance to help enterprises navigate the complexities of modern digital defense.
